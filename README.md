This is an HTML-only single-page website created for a technical assignment to showcase the **visual art gallery**.

## üöÄ Project Objective
The main goal of this assignment was to create a single-page product launch site using **only plain HTML**. The page serves to introduce the gadget, highlight its features, and provide comparison details.

## ‚ú® Key Features (Implemented Requirements)
The page demonstrates proficiency in fundamental HTML elements and structure, including:

* **HTML Boilerplate:** Proper document structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
* **Semantic Structure:** Use of various headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) and descriptive paragraphs.
* **Text Formatting:** Application of `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, and `<del>` tags.
* **Media & Links:** Insertion of an `<img>` tag with `alt` text, and an `<a>` tag for an external link.
* **HTML Lists:** Creation of both an **Ordered List** (with a `type` attribute) and an **Unordered List** (with a `type` attribute).
* **Data Presentation:** A comparison `<table>` with a header row and three data rows to compare different models.
* **Comments & Layout:** Inclusion of HTML comments to describe sections, and use of `<hr>` and `<br>` for basic layout separation.
